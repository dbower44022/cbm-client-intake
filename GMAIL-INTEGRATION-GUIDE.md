# Gmail Integration — Setup Guide

Step-by-step instructions for activating the Communications (Gmail
conversation) integration. Follow the parts **in order**: Google first, then
the CRM, then the app, then verify. Do everything against **crm-test / the
test app first**; repeat Parts 2–4 for prod once the test verification passes.

- What it does: the app reads each manager's `@cbmentors.org` mailbox, keeps
  only mail exchanged with the contacts of their active engagements /
  partners / sponsors, strips quoted text and signatures, stores the result as
  **conversations on the CRM record**, and lets managers read and reply from
  the session tools' Communications tab. Optional: Claude-generated summaries.
- Design: `prds/communications-gmail-integration.md`.
  CRM entity details: `cconversation-entity.md`.
- Everything is gated by `GMAIL_SYNC` (default off). Nothing in this guide
  changes behavior until Part 3 flips that flag.

## Prerequisites (already in place — verify, don't build)

| Requirement | Where it came from | How to check |
|---|---|---|
| Google service account with domain-wide delegation | The mailbox check/creation feature (v0.11.0) | Its JSON key is in the Email Setup screen (`/mentoradmin` → Email Setup) or the `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` env var in the gitignored overlay |
| Managed Postgres + `delivery-worker` + pre-deploy migrate | V2 activation | `/healthz` shows `durableStore: true` |
| App at **v0.35.0 or later** | The Communications build | `/healthz` version |
| Managers have a CBM mailbox + login | Mentor provisioning | Each syncing manager's `CMentorProfile` has `cbmEmail` set AND an assigned login User — **both are required**; profiles missing either are silently skipped |

---

## Part 1 — Google: authorize the Gmail scopes

The service account already has Directory scopes authorized. You are ADDING
two Gmail scopes to the SAME grant — no new service account, no new key.

1. **Find the service account's Client ID.** Open the service-account JSON
   key (the one pasted into Email Setup / the overlay) and copy the value of
   `"client_id"` — a ~21-digit number. (Alternatively: GCP Console → IAM &
   Admin → Service Accounts → the account → "Unique ID".)
2. Sign in to **admin.google.com** as a Workspace super-admin.
3. Go to **Security → Access and data control → API controls →
   Manage Domain Wide Delegation**.
4. Find the row with that Client ID (it exists — it carries the Directory
   scopes) and click **Edit**.
5. In the OAuth scopes box, keep the existing scopes and ADD these two,
   comma-separated:

   ```
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly,
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send
   ```

6. **Authorize** / Save. Propagation is usually minutes; allow up to an hour.
7. Also confirm the **Gmail API is enabled** on the service account's GCP
   project: GCP Console → APIs & Services → Library → "Gmail API" → Enable
   (the Admin SDK is already enabled for the Directory checks).

> Security note (for the record): domain-wide delegation is domain-wide — the
> app code restricts impersonation to (a) enumerated managers' mailboxes for
> sync and (b) the signed-in user's own mailbox for search/send, and logs every
> access. The scopes stay read+send only (no modify/delete). This was accepted
> in the design; see the plan §3.4.

## Part 2 — CRM: build the entities (crm-test first)

Full field-by-field spec: **`cconversation-entity.md`**. Every step below is
one action in the EspoCRM admin UI.

### 2.1 Create the two entities and their fields

1. Go to **Administration → Entity Manager → Create Entity**. Name:
   `CConversation`, type **Base**. Save.
2. In **CConversation → Fields**, add each field with **Add Field**:
   - `conversationStatus` — type **Enum**, options `Open`, `Closed`,
     `Uncertain`, default `Open`
   - `summary` — type **Text**
   - `actionItems` — type **Text**
   - `keyTopics` — type **Varchar**, max length 255
   - `participants` — type **Varchar**, max length 500
   - `firstMessageAt` — type **Date-Time**
   - `lastMessageAt` — type **Date-Time**
   - `messageCount` — type **Integer**
   - `summarizedAt` — type **Date-Time**, **no default value** (must be able
     to stay empty)
3. Back in Entity Manager, **Create Entity** again. Name: `CCommunication`,
   type **Base**. Save.
4. In **CCommunication → Fields**, add:
   - `direction` — type **Enum**, options `Inbound`, `Outbound`
   - `sentAt` — type **Date-Time**
   - `fromAddress` — type **Varchar**, max length 255 (**NOT the Email field
     type** — an email-type field silently stores nothing)
   - `fromName` — type **Varchar**, 255
   - `toAddresses` — type **Varchar**, 500
   - `ccAddresses` — type **Varchar**, 500
   - `snippet` — type **Varchar**, 255
   - `bodyCleaned` — type **Wysiwyg**
   - `rfcMessageId` — type **Varchar**, 255
   - `gmailThreadId` — type **Varchar**, 64
   - `gmailMessageId` — type **Varchar**, 64
   - `sourceMailbox` — type **Varchar**, 255

### 2.2 The relationships

**UI orientation** (Entity Manager → an entity → Relationships): the button is
**+ Create Link**; the list columns are **Foreign Link | Link Type | Link |
Foreign Entity**. In the create/edit dialog there are TWO panels each with a
"Name" field: the **left panel is the entity you're standing in** (its Name =
the **Link** column) and the **right panel is the other entity** (its Name =
the **Foreign Link** column). EspoCRM shows custom entities WITHOUT their
internal `C` prefix — "Conversation" in the UI is `CConversation` to the API.
EspoCRM's link types are directional: **One-to-Many means the LEFT entity is
the One and the RIGHT entity is the Many.** Never use One-to-One Right/Left
here.

**Deleting a wrong build first** (e.g. crm-test as first built): custom
relationship rows have a small **▾ arrow at the far right** → **Remove**; rows
without the arrow are system links — leave them. Removing a relationship
removes BOTH sides, so each one is deleted once, from either entity's screen.
The first crm-test build required removing, on **Communication →
Relationships**: the row with Link `conversation` (Foreign Entity
Conversation) and the row with Link `contact` (Foreign Entity Contact — a
per-message contact link that isn't in this design at all); and on
**Conversation → Relationships**: the rows with Link `engagements`,
`partnerProfiles`, `sponsorProfiles`, and `contacts`. Safe while no data
exists.

**Create all five links from Entity Manager → Conversation → Relationships →
+ Create Link** (so Conversation is always the left panel):

**Link 1 — Engagements**
1. Click **+ Create Link**.
2. **Link Type**: **Many-to-Many**
3. Left panel (Conversation) **Name**: `engagements`  **Label**: `Engagements`
4. Right panel **Entity**: **Engagement**
5. Right panel **Name**: `conversations` (lowercase, plural, exactly — the app
   reads `GET /CEngagement/{id}/conversations`)  **Label**: `Conversations`
6. **Save**. The list now shows: Foreign Link `conversations` | Many-to-Many |
   Link `engagements` | Engagement.

**Link 2 — Partner Profiles**
1. **+ Create Link**.
2. **Link Type**: **Many-to-Many**
3. Left **Name**: `partnerProfiles`  **Label**: `Partner Profiles`
4. Right **Entity**: **Partner Profile**
5. Right **Name**: `conversations`  **Label**: `Conversations`
6. **Save**.

**Link 3 — Sponsor Profiles**
1. **+ Create Link**.
2. **Link Type**: **Many-to-Many**
3. Left **Name**: `sponsorProfiles`  **Label**: `Sponsor Profiles`
4. Right **Entity**: **Sponsor Profile**
5. Right **Name**: `conversations`  **Label**: `Conversations`
6. **Save**.

**Link 4 — Contacts**
1. **+ Create Link**.
2. **Link Type**: **Many-to-Many**
3. Left **Name**: `contacts`  **Label**: `Contacts`
4. Right **Entity**: **Contact**
5. Right **Name**: `conversations`  **Label**: `Conversations`
6. **Save**.

**Link 5 — Communications (the only one that is NOT Many-to-Many)**
1. **+ Create Link**.
2. **Link Type**: **One-to-Many** (Conversation is the left = the One; one
   conversation has many messages)
3. Left **Name**: `communications`  **Label**: `Communications`
4. Right **Entity**: **Communication**
5. Right **Name**: `conversation` (singular — each message belongs to one
   conversation)  **Label**: `Conversation`
6. **Save**. The list shows: Foreign Link `conversation` | One-to-Many |
   Link `communications` | Communication.

### 2.3 Enable Collaborators on CConversation

1. In **Entity Manager → CConversation**, click **Edit** (the entity's own
   edit button — not Fields, not Layouts).
2. Check the **Collaborators** checkbox (the multi-user *Assigned Users*
   field — the same setting CEngagement and CSession have on). Required: the
   sync stamps the owning managers there so read-own roles see their
   conversations.
3. **Save**.

### 2.4 Grants

Four roles get access. crm-test role names below; **on the prod CRM the API
user's role is named `CustomAppAPIRole` instead of `ClientMentorIntakeRole`**
(the other three names match). The entities appear in the role editor as
**Conversation** and **Communication**.

**Role 1 of 4 — ClientMentorIntakeRole** (the intake API user — the sync's
writer):
1. Go to **Administration → Roles**.
2. Click **ClientMentorIntakeRole**, then **Edit**.
3. Scroll to **Conversation**: set **Access = enabled**, **Create = yes**,
   **Read = all**, **Edit = all**, **Delete = no**.
4. Scroll to **Communication**: set **Access = enabled**, **Create = yes**,
   **Read = all**, **Edit = all**, **Delete = no**.
5. Click **Save**.

**Role 2 of 4 — Mentor Role:**
1. **Administration → Roles → Mentor Role → Edit**.
2. **Conversation**: **Access = enabled**, **Create = no**, **Read = all**,
   **Edit = no**, **Delete = no**.
3. **Communication**: **Access = enabled**, **Create = no**, **Read = all**,
   **Edit = no**, **Delete = no**.
4. **Save**.

**Role 3 of 4 — Partner Manager Role:**
1. **Administration → Roles → Partner Manager Role → Edit**.
2. **Conversation**: **Access = enabled**, **Create = no**, **Read = all**,
   **Edit = no**, **Delete = no**.
3. **Communication**: **Access = enabled**, **Create = no**, **Read = all**,
   **Edit = no**, **Delete = no**.
4. **Save**.

**Role 4 of 4 — Sponsor Manager Role:**
1. **Administration → Roles → Sponsor Manager Role → Edit**.
2. **Conversation**: **Access = enabled**, **Create = no**, **Read = all**,
   **Edit = no**, **Delete = no**.
3. **Communication**: **Access = enabled**, **Create = no**, **Read = all**,
   **Edit = no**, **Delete = no**.
4. **Save**.

(The manager roles get Read = all because the app only shows a manager the
conversations linked to records they own; the broader CRM-side read is the
simple, working setting.)

### 2.5 Layouts (optional but recommended)

1. On the detail layout of **CEngagement**, **CPartnerProfile**, and
   **CSponsorProfile**, add a **Conversations** relationship panel (columns:
   name, conversationStatus, messageCount, lastMessageAt) — this is what
   makes correspondence visible to CRM users on the record.

### 2.6 Rebuild

1. **Administration → Rebuild.**

## Part 3 — App: enable the integration

Config goes in the gitignored App Platform overlay for the target app
(`.do/app.prod.yaml` = crm-test app, `.do/app.prod-crm.yaml` = prod app).

1. Add to the **web** service AND the **worker** envs:

   ```yaml
   - key: GMAIL_SYNC
     value: "true"
   ```

   (The web app needs it for the endpoints + `commsEnabled`; the worker for
   the sync loop. `DATABASE_URL` must already be on both — it is.)
2. Optional tuning (worker): `GMAIL_SYNC_SECONDS` (default 300),
   `GMAIL_BACKFILL` (default `newer_than:365d` — the initial history window),
   `COMMS_ENGAGEMENT_STATUSES`, `COMMS_PARTNER_EXCLUDED_STATUSES`.
3. Apply:

   ```bash
   doctl apps update <app-id> --spec .do/app.prod.yaml --wait
   ```

   The PRE_DEPLOY migrate job runs Alembic `0004_comms_sync` automatically
   (the sync-cursor + curation-override tables).
4. **Local dev** instead: set `GMAIL_SYNC=true`, `DATABASE_URL` (the
   docker-compose Postgres), and `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` in `.env`,
   run `uv run alembic upgrade head`, then `python -m worker` alongside
   uvicorn.

The service-account credentials need **no change** — the Gmail client reads
the same key the mailbox check uses (Email Setup config first, `GOOGLE_*` env
fallback).

## Part 4 — Verify (the go-live check)

Use a manager whose `CMentorProfile` has a `cbmEmail` + assigned User and who
owns at least one **active** engagement with a contact whose email you control.

1. **Worker is syncing.** `doctl apps logs <app-id> delivery-worker --type run -f`
   — expect `gmail sync enabled (every 300s)` at startup, then
   `gmail sync pass: {'mailboxes': N, 'fetched': …, 'stored': …, 'errors': 0}`
   each cycle. `mailboxes: 0` means no profile passed the cbmEmail+User check.
2. **Ingest.** From the contact's address, email the manager's
   `@cbmentors.org` address (subject e.g. `ZZTEST comms check`); have the
   manager reply from Gmail. Within a cycle: a `CConversation` appears in the
   CRM linked to the engagement, with two `CCommunication` messages, bodies
   cleaned (no quoted tails/signatures).
3. **CRM visibility.** Open the engagement in EspoCRM — the Conversations
   panel shows it.
4. **App read.** Sign in to the session tool as the manager → the record →
   Communications tab: the conversation lists and opens; quoted text renders
   demoted; "Open in Gmail" links work.
5. **Send.** Reply from the tab → the mail arrives at the contact's address
   threaded on the same conversation, shows in the manager's Gmail **Sent**,
   and appears in the tab immediately.
6. **Curation.** "Not related — remove" hides a conversation (and it stays
   hidden after the next sync); "Add emails…" finds an unrelated thread in
   the manager's mailbox and attaches it.
7. **Dedup.** CC a second manager on a test mail: still ONE CCommunication,
   both managers see the conversation.
8. **Cleanup**: delete the ZZTEST conversations/communications in the CRM UI.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `Gmail auth failed for <mailbox>` in worker logs | Scopes not authorized for the Client ID (Part 1), still propagating, or the Gmail API isn't enabled on the GCP project |
| `gmail sync: no Google service-account credentials configured` | No key in Email Setup and no `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` env on the worker |
| `mailboxes: 0` in the sync pass | No CMentorProfile has BOTH `cbmEmail` and an assigned login User |
| Conversation created but invisible in the app | Gate role lacks read on the entities, or `assignedUsers` wasn't enabled on CConversation (Part 2 steps 4–5) |
| `create CConversation failed: HTTP 403` | `CustomAppAPIRole` missing create/edit grants (Part 2 step 5) |
| Endpoints return 503 "isn't enabled" | `GMAIL_SYNC` not set on the **web** component |
| Endpoints return 503 "needs the database" | `DATABASE_URL` missing on the web component |
| Tab shows the sample banner | The browser cached old config — refresh; or `commsEnabled` false (web flag) |
| Mail from a contact never ingests | The record isn't in an active status, or the contact's sending address isn't on their CRM record — use "Add emails…" once and add the address to the contact |

## Part 5 — Optional: AI summaries

Off by default; everything above works without it. Enabling sends
conversation text to the Anthropic API (30-day retention) — get CBM's
sign-off first.

1. Create an API key at **console.anthropic.com** (Settings → API keys).
2. Add to the **worker** envs (encrypted):

   ```yaml
   - key: COMMS_AI_SUMMARY
     value: "true"
   - key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
     type: SECRET
     value: "sk-ant-…"
   ```

   Optional: `SUMMARY_MODEL` (default `claude-opus-4-8`).
3. Redeploy. The next sync pass summarizes every conversation whose
   `summarizedAt` is empty (i.e. all of them, once) and re-summarizes any
   conversation when new mail arrives. Expect ≈ $0.02–0.03 per summary at
   CBM volume.
4. Verify: conversations gain a status chip, a 2–4 sentence summary, and
   action items in both the CRM record and the tab.

## Rollback

Set `GMAIL_SYNC=false` (web + worker) and re-apply the spec — the endpoints
503, the tab reverts to the scaffold, the worker stops syncing. Stored
conversations remain in the CRM (harmless); Postgres cursors are kept, so
re-enabling resumes incrementally rather than re-backfilling.

## Prod rollout (after crm-test passes)

1. Part 2 on the prod CRM (same entities/grants/layouts).
2. Part 1 covers prod already if prod uses the same Workspace domain + service
   account (it does — `@cbmentors.org`); otherwise repeat it for the prod key.
3. Part 3 in `.do/app.prod-crm.yaml`, apply to the prod app.
4. Part 4 against a real manager, then announce to staff.
